		Some interesting excepts from the Map reading:
		<br>
		“For example, maps that placed Jerusalem at the center of the map implicitly made Jerusalem the center of the entire world. Such maps were driven by a desire to depict cultural or spiritual values, rather than to accurately account for the relation between different locations and landforms in absolute space.
		<br>
		For instance, many web maps utilize the Web Mercator projection, largely due to a path-dependency in mapping technologies resultant from the pioneering use of "slippy" map tiles by Google Maps in 2005. Of course the Mercator projection greatly distorts the relative size of continents, making Greenland appear to be the same size as Africa. Such decisions and priorities entangle web maps within a longer history of imperialist, Euro-centric visions of the world.
		<br>
		So why, if the Mercator projection is the "tool of imperialists", does Google Maps (as well as other web mappers) continue to utilize it? Are we to assume that all web mappers want to subjugate foreign people and claim their territories? Probably not.
		Though, of course, the US Department of Defense’s financial investments in various web mapping companies doesn’t particularly bode well in this respect. But at least they’ve declared Web Mercator unfit for official use, see: NGA Advisory Notice on "Web Mercator"
		 A key advantage of Web Mercator is that it preserves compass orientation and angles at different scales so map tiles can easily be constructed in a consistent way. It also provides a consistent way of structuring datasets so they can load and be displayed quickly and easily. For many, Web Mercator is convenient simply because there are a number of free mapping platforms that utilize the projection.
		In other words, these web mappers are prioritizing certain things–availability, price, ninety degree angles in street grids–over other things, such as relative size of land masses. This isn't wrong, per se, but it's important to remember that the setting of priorities in the mapping process can have significant, if unexpected, repercussions.
		<br>
		 As part of this broader shift in digital cultural practices, early online mapping was geared less towards thinking about representations of the world and more about the ethos of sharing one's own place(s) through the creation of placemarks, geotagging Flickr photos, etc.
		In short, we are the new Jerusalems! Which is incredible and also fairly egotistical; but that's people.
		Especially academics. Professorial egos are the worst. Trust us, we know.
		<br>
		We also have to remember it is not simply us making and orienting these maps.”

		<strong>Summary of my findings,</strong>

			<em>As we move further along into the digital era, it is important to know the history as well as the future of maps. In history, we saw a static centralized view of maps that exists from a set central point. Nowadays, we see that maps can be shared and used as a different source of tool that can be much more! They can be used to create political meaning, share information content, as well as for navigation. Furthermore, by bridging art and technology, these maps create new aesthetics that help people see the world differently.</em> </div>
