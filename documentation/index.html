			<li>Open the demo file index.html, copy from "START js copy section" to "END js copy section" and paste before the &lt;/body&gt; close tag element of your HTML page.</li>
			<li>Copy the form code you choose and put it in your HTML page where you want to show it. Example: if you want to use the "General Contact Form" you should copy the code from "START copy section: General Contact Form" to "END copy section: General Contact Form".</li>
			<li>Open the file: /contactme/configs.php and fill in the values for the only 3 required configs: from_name, from_address, to_addresses. (each option is well explained on the right).</li>

			<li>In the "$fields" array, each line is for one input of the form.</li>
			<li>By maintain the same order of the fields in the HTML form, add a new line for the Checkbox or Radio button (it depends on what you are adding). Here an exemple for a Checkbox: <pre>$fields[] = array('name' => 'privacy', 'display_name' => 'Privacy terms', 'type' => 'checkbox', 'required' => true);</pre></li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>ATTENTION:</strong> make sure to set "name" value equal to the "name" attribute of the field in the HTML form code.</p>

		<h3 id="chooseThemeDesign"><strong>F) Choose theme design </strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>We have created 7 concrete examples and 4 different graphics themes. You can choose between 4 different themes: Default, Modern, London, Minimal.</p>

		<p>This is the first code line of the "General Contact Form"</p>

		<p style="font-style:italic;">&lt;form class="contactMe small" action="contactme/send-general-form.php" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data"&gt;</p>
		
		<p>The Defalt Theme is already active, but if you want to change the theme, you have to replace <span style="font-style:italic;">class="contactMe small"</span> with: <span style="font-style:italic;">class="contactMe small theme-modern"</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">class="contactMe small theme-london"</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">class="contactMe small theme-minimal"</span></p>
		
		<hr>

		<h3 id="changeAllowedUploadFilesType"><strong>G) Change allowed upload files type</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>You can change the allowed upload file type for each file input, to do it follow these steps:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>In the HTML form code, change the value of "data-allowedtypes" by adding/removing allowed extensions. (must be separated by comma)</li>
			<li>Set the same extensions also in the sending .php file of the form you chose. (Example: the sending file for the General Contact Form is /contactme/send-general-form.php). In the "$fields" array, each line is for one input of the form, find the one of the upload file input and at the end add this code: <pre>, 'allowed_types' => array('jpg', 'png', 'zip')</pre> Of course you have to put inside the extensions that you want to allow.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>ATTENTION:</strong> Each line already has something similar, for example: <i>"required" => true</i> so don't forget the comma.</p>

		<p><strong>ATTENTION:</strong> The default allowed types array is in the configs.php file. It's used when no extensions are specified in the sending .php file.</p>

		<p>If you're using only one form or each upload input has to accept the same extensions type, you can simply edit the types array in the configs.php file, but if you are using more than one form or each upload input has to accept different extensions type, you have to specify the allowed extensions in each sending files.</p>

		<hr>
		
		<h3 id="connect2DateFields"><strong>H) Connect 2 date fields</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>You can connect 2 date fields if the second date is required to be after the first. This is useful if you need to use them like in a hotel check-in / check-out.</p>

		<p>To do it follow these steps:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Add un unique ID attribute to both the date fields. (for example: id="date-start-1" and id="date-end-1").</li>
			<li>On the Start Date field add the attribute "data-idconnecteddateend" and set as value the ID of the End Date field. (for example: data-idconnecteddateend="date-end-1").</li>
			<li>On the End Date field add the attribute "data-idconnecteddatestart" and set as value the ID of the Start Date field. (for example: data-idconnecteddatestart="date-start-1").</li>
		</ul>

		<p>That's it, now these 2 date fields are connected.</p>

		<p>NOTE: You can see how it works in our demo: HOTEL CONTACT FORM</p>

		<p><strong>ATTENTION:</strong> If you want to remove this feature, just remove the ID attribute to both the date fields. Remove also the attribute "data-idconnecteddateend" from the End Date field and the attribute "data-idconnecteddatestart" from the Start Date field.</p>
